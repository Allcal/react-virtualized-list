# react-virtualized-list
Simple virtualization technique applied to a react list component

Lists tend to grow and have hundreds of DOM elements which can become a problem specially on mobile devices. Using a virtuzalition technique (or windowing) we can discard the elements that are not visible on the viewport thus improving the performance when scrolling a list with thousands of elements.
